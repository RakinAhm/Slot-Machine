# Building a text based slot machine where the user deposits a certain amount of money, they are then allowed to bet on either one, two or three lines of the slot machine and then determine if they won. If they got any lines, we multiply their bet by the value of the line, add that to their balance and then allow them to keep playing until they want to cash out or until they run out of money
